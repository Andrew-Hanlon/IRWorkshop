delay in the Freq domain: 
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31586803/delay-a-signal-in-time-domain-with-a-phase-change-in-the-frequency-domain-after
Ci = ci * Exp(-2*pi*i * sampleDelay / SIZE)
can delay different freq spectrums by different amount and that seems to work well.


Todo:

Finish up Spectrum features
	Gain randomization
	Gain Stretch
	Phase delay bands
Implement output stage
Solo spectrum stage
solo per impulse
On chart, allow showing Left or Right output processed sample, or the (current) unprocessed, direct-from-spectrum sample
Plot a line on the sample chart showing the sample window length (set by master)
Disable UI features that are rendered useless by minimum phase enabled
Windowing features
New/Open/Save feature
Hook up remaining menu item commands
Rename project, create icon




-----------------------------------
This is a bit too complex for a first draft...

Place up to 8 sources on a distance/direction map for stereo effect.
Each point has:
Angle
Distance
Gain
Phase Invert
Low pass
High Pass

Ear Bleed Control - how much L channel affect R: - Note this is SEPARATE from the right ear hearing what's on the left side, for example.
Low pass
Gain
Delay

Some random toughts:

Angle Falloff, the curve that controls the gain and low and high cut applied to a node based on its angle relative to ear placement.
