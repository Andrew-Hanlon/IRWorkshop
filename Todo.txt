delay in the Freq domain: 
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31586803/delay-a-signal-in-time-domain-with-a-phase-change-in-the-frequency-domain-after
Ci = ci * Exp(-2*pi*i * sampleDelay / SIZE)
can delay different freq spectrums by different amount and that seems to work well.


Todo:

Interpolate wav input samples
Move realtime processing to separate process
Seed and Shift for gain randomization
verify that samplerate changes are OK and that everythign works at different samplerates - make sure you can change samplerate easy during process

-----------------------------------
This is a bit too complex for a first draft...

Place up to 8 sources on a distance/direction map for stereo effect.
Each point has:
Angle
Distance
Gain
Phase Invert
Low pass
High Pass

Ear Bleed Control - how much L channel affect R: - Note this is SEPARATE from the right ear hearing what's on the left side, for example.
Low pass
Gain
Delay

Some random toughts:

Angle Falloff, the curve that controls the gain and low and high cut applied to a node based on its angle relative to ear placement.
