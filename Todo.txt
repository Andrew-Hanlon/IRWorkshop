delay in the Freq domain: 
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31586803/delay-a-signal-in-time-domain-with-a-phase-change-in-the-frequency-domain-after
Ci = ci * Exp(-2*pi*i * sampleDelay / SIZE)
can delay different freq spectrums by different amount and that seems to work well.


Todo:

Finish up Spectrum features
	Phase delay bands
Implement output stage
Add/remove/reorder impulses
solo per impulse
On chart, allow showing Left or Right output processed sample, or the (current) unprocessed, direct-from-spectrum sample
Windowing features
New/Open/Save feature


-----------------------------------
This is a bit too complex for a first draft...

Place up to 8 sources on a distance/direction map for stereo effect.
Each point has:
Angle
Distance
Gain
Phase Invert
Low pass
High Pass

Ear Bleed Control - how much L channel affect R: - Note this is SEPARATE from the right ear hearing what's on the left side, for example.
Low pass
Gain
Delay

Some random toughts:

Angle Falloff, the curve that controls the gain and low and high cut applied to a node based on its angle relative to ear placement.
