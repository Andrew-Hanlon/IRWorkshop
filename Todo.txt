More features that can be added:

Adjust Phase band frequency bands by a multiplier

EQ Left-right notcher
Same 16 delayed bands and the phase banding, cuts a frequency band on one side while boosting it on the other
see Waves PS22 plugin for inspiration
Overall parameters:
	Depth - Cnotrols the maximum boost/cut of each band
	Smoothing (apply an average smoother to the response like in spectrum processor)

16 delayed bands, like the phase banding effect in the spectrum processor
	At center - no delay on either side
	Full left - full amount of delay applied to left side
	Full right - full amount of delay applied to right side
Overall parameters:
	Amount of delay - control how much delay is applied at the extremes of each band
	Freq Shift - Move the fixed frequency bands up or down in Hz

Mid and Side volume

top right chart - Stereo spce - show the left/right frequency plots (overlayed), and add a third, filled-line series to show the phase offset
