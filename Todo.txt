delay in the Freq domain: 

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31586803/delay-a-signal-in-time-domain-with-a-phase-change-in-the-frequency-domain-after

Ci = ci * Exp(-2*pi*i * sampleDelay / SIZE)

can delay different freq spectrums by different amount and that seems to work well.


implement convolution in c++, rest in c#.

add a "stretch magnitude" feature, which scales (on a log axis) the magnitude response to accentuate or "squash" resonant peaks.

Add Proximity feature

"Zero phase"

High and low pass
Delay LR (HAAS effect-ish) and volume LR (pan)


Add smoothing/peak enhancement to full spectrum
Peak enhancement should have 3 modes: Bipolar, Amplify and Reduce.
weighted average provides the baseline magnitude to which the operation is applied over.

Add smoothed noise to parts of the spectrum. Gets added 
Controls:
Smooth
Freq Range
Amount


---------------------------------------
More refined idea here below
-----------------------


Offer 8 blocks of "processing", applied serially.
block controls:

Min Freq
Max Freq
Crossover (step, linear, cosine) - the transition from the in and out of band
Gain
Delay

Smooth range (how many samples in window)
Stretch Squash Amount (applied over the smoothed range)
Stretch Square Mode (Bipolar, Amplify and Reduce)

Random Smoothness
Random Seed
Random Amount
Random Skew - a modifier on the random number (e.g. power(x, a) where a is the skew from 0.1...10)
Random Mode (Bipolar, Amplify and Reduce)

Random delay to frequency bands - stereo widener effect
Phase Bands - how many bands to split the range into
PhaseDelayAmount - how much delay on average to apply (scales the random number per band)
PhaseDelaySeed - random seed

stretch frequency range left to right



---------------------------------
Simpler mixing stage

Sample Delay L/R (single slider)
Pan L/R
Phase Invert left and right
Low/Hi pass left and right



-----------------------------------
This is a bit too complex for a first draft...

Place up to 8 sources on a distance/direction map for stereo effect.
Each point has:
Angle
Distance
Gain
Phase Invert
Low pass
High Pass

Ear Bleed Control - how much L channel affect R: - Note this is SEPARATE from the right ear hearing what's on the left side, for example.
Low pass
Gain
Delay

Some random toughts:

Angle Falloff, the curve that controls the gain and low and high cut applied to a node based on its angle relative to ear placement.
